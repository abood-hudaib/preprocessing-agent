# Preprocessing Agent

## Overview
This project implements a simple and robust data preprocessing agent.
The goal of this agent is to clean and prepare raw datasets before any analysis or machine learning.

## Version
v1.0 — Clean & Report

## Scope of v1.0
The agent performs only basic preprocessing tasks:
- Load CSV or Excel files
- Detect basic data types
- Handle missing values
- Remove duplicate rows
- Produce a cleaned dataset
- Generate a text report explaining all preprocessing decisions

## Out of Scope
The following are intentionally excluded from v1.0:
- Data analysis
- Visualization
- Machine learning
- Predictions or modeling

## Design Philosophy
- Small and focused
- Predictable behavior
- Explicit preprocessing decisions
- Clean output and clear reporting
